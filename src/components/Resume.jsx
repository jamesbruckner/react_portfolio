I have a wide variety of work experience from construction, to film production, business and residential delivery,  to many different levels of customer service. I see myself as a dedicated member of  any team I am given the opportunity to be a part of. I excel as a taskmaster and workhorse. I only find satisfaction in my work when I deliver consistently and develop a product of the highest quality.  I know I will be a valuable addition to your team and a positive presence in the workplace.

<h5>EXPERIENCE</h5>

<p className="skills">
<span className="skill-name">Communication:</span> I have always maintained strong communication skills with colleagues, management, customers, and clients. In my wide experience, from construction sites, to restaurants, delivery routes, offices, and warehouses, nothing works without a clear idea of where you and others are at in a project, as well as knowing the exact needs of the people you’re serving.
</p>

<p className="skills">
<span className="skill-name">Time Management:</span> I’m proficient at multitasking and completing my tasks as efficiently as possible. I can serve ten tables as well as I can manage the air compressors of 10 different drill rigs. During my time at FedEx, I ran a complex industrial business route with heavy pickups in overlapping time slots in different parts of my route. I needed a strong understanding of how long tasks would take to complete and the optimal order to do them in. 
</p>

<p className="skills">
<span className="skill-name">Teamwork:</span> I’m efficient at working alone but really come into my own as part of a team. I ask for help sparingly, knowing when it is appropriate, but am generous with my time and energy to help others when I’m confident I can still complete my own tasks. This balance is frequently tested when taking tables from other’s sections in a restaurant as well as trading pickups with other drivers and taking on their deliveries when their trucks are over-packed. 
</p> 

<p className="skills">
<span className="skill-name">Leadership:</span> When called upon, I have been comfortable as a leader. I ran my own department during my time at the Woodstock Film Festival, coordinating employees distributing valuable packages throughout the region and overseeing their installation, while making sure they understood the importance of each phase of the job despite their inexperience.
</p>

<p className="skills">
<span className="skill-name">Organization:</span> Organization is as important as communication for most aspects of a job. I need to know where materials are and and have systems in place not just for functionality but also aesthetically for my own satisfaction. I was meticulous about packing my truck at FedEx to the point where I could see every address tag without having to move any boxes and nothing would fall off the shelves while driving because they were all fit together so securely.
